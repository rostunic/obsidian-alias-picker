# Alias Picker
The Alias Picker plugin for Obsidian introduces two commands: 'Pick alias' and 'Pick block'.
These commands simplify the process of modifying wiki or Markdown links within your notes.

## Features:
Pick alias: Easily select an alternative alias for the current link from the available aliases for the file.

Pick block: Modify the referenced block within the file using the '#^BlockIdentifier' syntax.

## How to use:
With the cursor on the link, execute the 'Pick alias' or 'Pick block' command from the plugin menu or via keyboard shortcuts.
Choose from the available blocks or aliases to make your desired changes.
